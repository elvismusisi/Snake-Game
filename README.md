# Snake Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played in a 15x15 grid, and the player controls the snake's movement to eat food and grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Responsive design with a 15x15 grid.
- Snake grows longer upon eating food.
- Game resets on collisions with walls or the snake's body.
- Arrow keys control the direction of the snake.
- Basic styling with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
4. Grow the snake by eating red food squares.
5. Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's body.

## Customization

- Developers can customize the game by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Additional features, improvements, and styling can be added for a personalized experience.
- Consider expanding the game logic, adding levels, or incorporating additional visual elements.
